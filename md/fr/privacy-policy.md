Professional or financial advisors also provide us with information about themselves, such as their contact information and licensure information.

**Information we collect from private and publicly accessible sources**

We and our vendors may collect information about you that is publicly available, including from publicly accessible government lists of restricted persons, public databases, media and internet searches (e.g., we may check an investor's public LinkedIn profile to confirm his/her employment or source of income, we may do Google searches to corroborate public databases). We and or our third-party verification providers may also collect information about you from non-public databases of third parties, to the extent permitted under applicable law.

**Information we collect from our business partners and social media networks**

We may also maintain pages for our company and our products on a variety of third-party platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, and other social networking services. When you interact with our pages on those third-party platforms, the third-party's privacy policy will govern your interactions on the relevant platform. If the third-party platform provides us with information about our pages on those platforms or your interactions with them, we will treat that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**Sensitive Personal Information**

We ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive Personal Information (e.g., information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic or biometric information, sexual orientation, or criminal convictions or offenses) on the Service, or otherwise to us.

If you send or disclose any sensitive Personal Information to us when you use the Services, you must consent to our processing and use of such sensitive Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We make every effort to promptly process all unsubscribe requests.

Please note that blocking or disabling cookies may negatively impact your experience using the Website, as some features and services on our Website may not work properly. Depending on your mobile device and operating system, you may not be able to delete or block all cookies.

If you have any questions about reviewing, modifying, or deleting your information, or if you want to remove your name or comments from our website or publicly displayed content, you can contact us directly at info@linear.finance. We may not be able to modify or delete your information in all circumstances.

**Targeted online advertising**

Some of the business partners that collect information about users' activities on our Website may be members of organizations or programs that provide choices to individuals regarding the use of their browsing behavior or mobile application usage for purposes of targeted advertising.

Users may opt out of receiving targeted advertising on websites through members of the Network Advertising Initiative by clicking here or the Digital Advertising Alliance by clicking here. European users may opt out of receiving targeted advertising on websites through members of the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance by clicking here, selecting the user's country, and then clicking "Choices" (or similarly-titled link). Please note that we also may work with companies that offer their own opt-out mechanisms and may not participate in the opt-out mechanisms that we linked above.

If you choose to opt-out of targeted advertisements, you will still see advertisements online but they may not be relevant to you. Even if you do choose to opt out, not all companies that serve online behavioural advertising are included in this list, and so you may still receive some cookies and tailored advertisements from companies that are not listed.

**Choosing not to share your Personal Information**

Where we are required by law to collect your Personal Information, or where we need your Personal Information in order to provide services or the Website to you, if you do not provide this information when requested (or you later ask to delete it), we may not be able to provide you with our services. We will tell you what information you must provide to receive the Services by designating it as required on or through the Services or through other appropriate means.

## International Data Transfers

Linear is headquartered in the Hong Kong and has service providers in other countries, and your Personal Information may be transferred to the Hong Kong or other locations outside of your province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.

European users should read the important information provided here about transfer of Personal Information outside of Europe.

## Data Security

We care about the security of your information and employ physical, administrative, and technological safeguards designed to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through our Website. These measures are designed to appropriately protect Personal Information against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the Personal Information in our possession.

**Automated decision-making**

We, or a third party verification provider, may perform automated identification, KYC, and AML checks, and verifications of your financial status, which may lead to an automated refusal of access to our Service. These checks are necessary for entering into, or performing, a contract with you; and are authorized by relevant law, e.g., to prevent fraud. If you believe that you have been wrongfully refused access to the Service, you may contact us at info@linear.finance, and we will review the information you provide.

**Use for new purposes**

We may use your Personal Information for reasons not described in this Privacy Policy where permitted by law and the reason is compatible with the purpose for which we collected it. If we need to use your Personal Information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and explain the applicable legal basis.

**Retention**

We will only retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Information, the purposes for which we process your Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, the applicable legal requirements, and the statute of limitations.

When we no longer require the Personal Information we have otherwise collected about you, we will dissociate such information from the information attached to your content. In some circumstances we may anonymize your Personal Information (so that it can no longer be associated with you), in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

**Your rights**

European data protection laws give European users certain rights regarding their Personal Information. If you are located within the European Union, you may ask us to take the following actions in relation to your Personal Information that we hold:

* Withdraw consent. Withdraw any consent you previously provided to us. We will apply your preferences going forward and this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before your consent withdrawal.
* Access. Provide you with information about our processing of your Personal Information and give you access to your Personal Information.
* Correct. Update or correct inaccuracies in your Personal Information.
* Delete. Delete your Personal Information.
* Transfer. Transfer a machine-readable copy of your Personal Information to you or a third party of your choice.
* Restrict. Restrict the processing of your Personal Information.
* Object. Object to our reliance on our legitimate interests as the basis of our processing of your Personal Information.

You can submit these requests by email to info@linear.finance. We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your request. Applicable law may require or permit us to decline your request. If we decline your request, we will tell you why, subject to legal restrictions. If you would like to submit a complaint about our use of your Personal Information or response to your requests regarding your Personal Information, you may contact us as described above or submit a complaint to the data protection regulator in your jurisdiction. You can find your data protection regulator [here](https://www.liquefy.com/statement/privacy#).

**Cross-Border Data Transfer**

Whenever we transfer your Personal Information out of Europe to countries not deemed by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of Personal Information protection, the transfer will be based:

* Pursuant to the recipient's compliance with standard contractual clauses, EU-US Privacy Shield, or Binding Corporate Rules
* Pursuant to the consent of the individual to whom the Personal Information pertains
* As otherwise permitted by applicable European requirements.

Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your Personal Information out of Europe.
